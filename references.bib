  abstract  = "Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder
               the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a
               preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the
               counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin
               tossing developed by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery (D-H-M;
               2007). The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin,
               it tends to land on the same side it started -- D-H-M estimated
               the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51\%. Our
               data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins
               landed on the same side more often than not,
               $\text\{Pr\}(\text\{same side\}) = 0.508$, 95\% credible
               interval (CI) [$0.506$, $0.509$],
               $\text\{BF\}_\{\text\{same-side bias\}\} = 2364$. Furthermore,
               the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the
               degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the
               generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin --
               with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally
               likely to land heads or tails: $\text\{Pr\}(\text\{heads\}) =
               0.500$, 95\% CI [$0.498$, $0.502$],
               $\text\{BF\}_\{\text\{heads-tails bias\}\} = 0.183$.
               Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to
               vary across coins. Our data therefore provide strong evidence
               that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends
               to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling
               statistical support for D-H-M physics model of coin tossing.",

  abstract  = "A fundamental problem in text data mining is to extract
               meaningful structure from document streams that arrive
               continuously over time. E-mail and news articles are two natural
               examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that
               appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade
               away. The published literature in a particular research field
               can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time
               scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is
               the following intuitive premise---that the appearance of a topic
               in a document stream is signaled by a ``burst of activity,''
               with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic
               emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal
               approach for modeling such ``bursts,'' in such a way that they
               can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an
               organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content.
               The approach is based on modeling the stream using an
               infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as
               state transitions; it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with
               models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The
               resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested
               representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical
               structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and
               research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures
               have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to
               them.",
