hospital presentation in COVID-19 patients: Findings from a large Brazilian
cohort](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36375382/)

## Examples

### Blog

Posts on statistical modeling and data analysis:

* [Drafting a fantasy football team](https://assuncaolfi.github.io/site/blog/fantasy-football):
  In this post, I delve into the data for the 2022 season of a brazilian fantasy
  football league, formulate a mixed integer linear program to draft the optimal
  team; and present initial concepts for forecasting player scores using mixed
  effects linear models.

* [Additive aging curve](https://assuncaolfi.github.io/site/blog/aging-curve):
  In this post, I compare empirical and parametric approaches to modeling aging-
  curve-like non-monotonic relationships using data from a verbal working memory
  test.

Some tools used in my blog: Python, `cvxpy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `polars`,
`pymc`.

### Repositories

* [site](https://github.com/assuncaolfi/site): My website and blog post codes
  using Quarto
* [savvi](https://github.com/assuncaolfi/savvi): Python package for Safe
  Anytime Valid Inference
* [tophat](https://github.com/assuncaolfi/tophat): Historical database of
  Cartola, a fantasy football league
* [qlm](https://github.com/assuncaolfi/qlm): R package to generate predictive
  SQL queries from linear models

### Others

* [Pod & Dev podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/br/podcast/evolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-e-perspectivas-futuras-para-intelig%C3%AAncia-artificial/id1666875166?i=1000628439729&l=en-GB),
  where I talk (in portuguese) about the challenges in pricing digital products
  and causal assumptions we made to overcome these challenges in our model at
  Hotmart. We also discuss good and bad use cases for large language models, as
  well as how models with 2 parameters can be as useful as models with 200 million
  parameters.
