I'm Lu√≠s[^1].

[^1]: ![](assets/me.jpeg)

I'm a statistician and data scientist -- I help people make better decisions
under uncertainty. To achieve this, I design experiments, model causal
relationships, estimate probabilities, and [more](cv.qmd).

I also enjoy hiking, music and [woodworking](woodworking.qmd). I live with my
partner and our two cats[^2] in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
