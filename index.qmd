Hello! I'm Luís Assunção[^1] and this is my website.

[^1]: ![](assets/me.jpeg)

I'm a statistician and data scientist -- my goal is to help people make better
decisions under uncertainty. To achieve this, I design experiments, infer causal
relationships, model probabilities, and [more](cv.html).

I also enjoy hiking, music and woodworking. I live with my partner and our
ginger cat[^2] in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
