Hello! I'm Luís Assunção and this is my website.

I'm a statistician and data scientist -- my goal is to help people make better
decisions under uncertainty. To achieve this, I design experiments, infer causal
relationships, model probabilities, and [more](cv.html).

I also enjoy hiking, music and woodworking. I live with my partner and our
ginger cat in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
