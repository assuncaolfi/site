Hello! My name is Luís Assunção and I'm a Data Scientist and Statistician.

My work is to help people make decisions under uncertainty through
experimentation, causal inference and probabilistic modeling.

I also enjoy hiking, music and woodworking. I live with my partner and our
ginger cat in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

## Experience

### [Hotmart](https://hotmart.com/en) 

**Staff Data Scientist | April 2020 - present**  

To help creators live their passions, I worked in:

* Developing an in-house AB testing framework with optional stopping
* Consulting for and developing randomized controlled trials
* Estimating causal effects in non-randomized experiments
* Hierarchical modeling of pricing elasticity for digital products 
* Hidden state modeling of evergreen vs launching sales strategies
* Topification and latent variable modeling for creators and products

### [Oper](https://operdata.com.br) 

**Data Scientist | Oct 2018 - March 2020**  

For companies such as AB InBev and GTB to understand and make decisions from
data, I worked in:

* Spatial modeling of pricing elasticity for beverages
* Multi-touchpoint attribution modeling

### [IRIS](https://irisbh.com.br/en/) 

**Intern | 2015 - 2017**

To defend and promote public policies that advance human rights in the digital
matters, I worked in:

* Collecting, wrangling and describing data

## Examples

### Blog

Some blog posts:

* [Picking a fantasy football team](https://assuncaolfi.github.io/site/blog/fantasy-football):
  In this post, I delve into the data for the 2022 season of a brazilian fantasy
  football league; formulate a mixed integer linear program to pick the optimal
  team; and present initial concepts for forecasting player scores using mixed
  effects linear models.
  
* [Parametric non-monotonic models](https://assuncaolfi.github.io/site/blog/non-monotonic):
  In this post, I analyse some function alternatives for modeling non-monotonic
  relationships with interpretable parameters, and compare these models using a
a cognitive decline dataset.

`pulp`.

### Other stuff

* [Pod e Dev podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/br/podcast/evolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-e-perspectivas-futuras-para-intelig%C3%AAncia-artificial/id1666875166?i=1000628439729&l=en-GB),
where I talk (in portuguese) about the challenges in pricing digital products
and causal assumptions we made to overcome these challenges in our model at
Hotmart. We also discuss good and bad use cases for large language models, as
well as how models with 2 parameters can be as useful as models with 200 million
parameters.
