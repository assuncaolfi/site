We are tasked with forming a team of 11 players plus a coach, all within our budget and adhering to a valid formation. A captain must be chosen from among the players, excluding the coach.\nThe market is available until the round starts. Players then earn scores based on their real-life match performances. Our team’s score is the aggregate of our players’ scores, with our captain’s score doubled in the 2022 season.\nFollowing the conclusion of the round, player values are recalibrated based on performance -— with increases for scores above their average and decreases for below-average performances. Our budget for the next round is our previous budget, plus the sum of our players’ value variations."

A player is a structure like this:\n\n\nPlayer(round=0, player=42234, team=264, position=1, games=0, average=0.0, value=10.0, score=0.0, appreciation=0.0, minimum=4.53)\n\n\nLet’s get the list of markets for 2022 and flatten it into a single DataFrame:\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| round   player   team   position   …   value   score   appreciation   minimum |\n+===============================================================================+\n| 1       37424    1371   6          …   3.0     0.0     0.0            0.0     |\n| 1       37646    314    3          …   5.0     0.0     0.0            2.3     |\n| 1       37656    266    1          …   9.0     0.0     0.0            4.08    |\n| …       …        …      …          …   …       …       …              …       |\n| 38      121398   354    4          …   1.0     0.0     0.0            0.0     |\n| 38      121399   354    4          …   1.0     0.0     0.0            0.0     |\n| 38      121400   354    5          …   1.0     0.0     0.0            0.0     |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nshape: (30_063, 10)\n\n\nNow, let’s focus on a specific player to illustrate our data while we wrangle it:\n\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| round   player   team   position   …   value   score   appreciation   minimum |\n+===============================================================================+\n| 1       42234    264    1          …   10.0    0.0     0.0            4.53    |\n| 2       42234    264    1          …   7.93    2.0     -2.07          5.52    |\n| 3       42234    264    1          …   10.44   11.0    2.51           4.75    |\n| …       …        …      …          …   …       …       …              …       |\n| 36      42234    264    1          …   11.51   0.0     0.03           3.63    |\n| 37      42234    264    1          …   12.68   0.0     1.17           9.29    |\n| 38      42234    264    1          …   11.06   0.0     -1.62          1.37    |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nshape: (38, 10)\n\n\n\nFiltering participation\nPlayers will show up in the market for many rounds that they do not participate in. However, for our analysis, we are only interested in players that actually played a game in the round.\nEach player has a status field intended to indicate their participation in the round.

To test this hypothesis, we backtest the same strategy with unlimited budget from the start:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth runs are nearly identical, which is evidence that focusing on appreciation is not so important if we have accurate predictions for the scores. If we predict scores perfectly, we get a near perfect run.\nTo put our backtests into perspective, the 2022 season champion had a total score of 3434.37. This is very impressive and not very far from the near perfect run."

In this case, we need to include prior information. One way to do that would be to use data from previous seasons. However, we know a variable where this information is already encoded: the player value. Each season starts with players valued according to their past performance. Knowing this, all our models start with \\(\\hat{s} = v\\) in the first round.\nLet’s use Bambi (Capretto et al. 2022) and its default priors to fit our models. We won’t delve into convergence diagnostics, since we are more interested in the average of the predictive posteriors and the backtest itself is measure of the prediction quality.\n\nCapretto, Tomás, Camen Piho, Ravin Kumar, Jacob Westfall, Tal Yarkoni, and Osvaldo A Martin. 2022. “Bambi: A Simple Interface for Fitting Bayesian Linear Models in Python.” Journal of Statistical Software 103 (15): 1–29. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v103.i15.\n\nBailey, David H., Jonathan M.

After some experimentation, I concluded they are not a good fit for this problem: either because they assume independence between observations, or because they are too data hungry. Also, tuning these models for backtests might lead us into a rabbit hole (Bailey et al. 2013).\n\nPlayer average\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{\\hat{s}} = \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\\\\n\\mathbf{s} \\sim N(\\mathbf{\\hat{s}}, \\sigma),\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a dummy-encoded matrix of players; \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) is a vector of parameters for each player.\nIn this model, \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) is simply a vector of player averages. Let’s also consider that players that show up in the middle of the season have an average of zero before their first round. This will be our baseline model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer random effects\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{\\hat{s}} = \\alpha + \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{b} \\\\\n\\mathbf{b} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b),\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is an intercept and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a vector of player random effects.\nThis model performs significantly better than the average model, possibly because of the partial pooling between the random effects, that pulls large effects towards the overall mean (Clark 2019). In our dataset, it’s common for players that played one or two games to have large averages by chance.\n\nClark, Michael. 2019. “Michael Clark: Shrinkage in Mixed Effects Models.” https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-05-14-shrinkage-in-mixed-models/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixture mixed effects\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\hat{s}} = \\alpha + \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} + \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{b},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of the dummy-encoded fixture variables: the player team, whether they are playing at home, and their adversary team variables; \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) is a vector of fixed effects.\nThis model brings more context to our predictions. It also provides a reasonable way to predict a new player, by setting their \\(b = 0\\) (the mean of the random effects). However, it does not improve significantly over our random effects model."

There are more ideas we could explore to improve our chances of winning:\n\nenriching our data and models with player scouts;\nincluding more information in our priors;\ntesting strategies that balance predicted score and appreciation;\nfurther model diagnostics.\n\nHowever, I suppose expert human player predictions have a certain edge over those of hobbyist statistical models in fantasy leagues, due to the fact that there are all sorts of relevant data unavailable in public datasets.\nAt least, this seems to be the case for brazilian soccer, also known as “a little box of surprises”."

    "text": "Warning\n\n\n\nThis post is a draft.\nRecently, I helped design an experiment measuring a binary response against a continuous variable. If the user abandoned their cart at time zero, then we delayed for a variable number of minutes before reminding them to finish their purchase. The delay has a non-monotonic relationship to the response: as the delay increases, so does the purchase rate; then the rate peaks; and finally it decreases.\nCausally, we may decompose this process into two: as the delay increases, the user 1) becomes more available for and 2) loses interest in purchasing the product. This is a common phenomena in different time-based scenarios. In sports, the “aging curve” refers to how a player’s performance increases with age, then decreases. As the player gets older, they get 1) better at the sport and 2) physically weaker.\nAndrew Gelman wrote about this a couple of times in his blog: see his posts from 2018 and 2023, where Gelman suggests modeling these processes using an additive function like:\n\\[g(x) = g_1(x) + g_2(x),\\]\nwhere\n\\(g_1(x)\\) is a monotonically increasing function with a right asymptote; and\n\\(g_2(x)\\) is a monotonically decreasing function with a left asymptote.\nIn this post, we’ll analyse an experimental dataset by fitting and comparing three different models: a non-parametric bootstrap, a semi-parametric spline and a fully parametric decomposable curve like \\(g(x)\\)."

[…] We continued data collection for each experiment for approximately 1 year, sufficient to obtain around 10,000 participants, which allowed fine-grained age-of-peak-performance analysis.\n\nThe dataset for Experiment 2 is available online (Germine and Hartshorne 2016) and includes results of the Digit Span verbal working memory test, part of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) supertests. In the Digit Span test, subjects must repeat lists of digits, either in the same or reversed order.\n\nGermine, Laura, and Joshua K Hartshorne. 2016. “Hartshorne & Germine (2015) When Does Cognitive Functioning Peak?” OSF. osf.io/f2saj.\nLet’s plot the relationship between age and Digit Span performance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, it’s still unclear if this relationship follows an aging curve, but we’ll get back to this matter in the next section."

    "text": "Bootstrap estimates\nIn the original paper, the authors describe a bootstrap resampling procedure to estimate the distribution of ages of peak performance:\n\nEstimates and standard errors for age of peak performance were calculated using a bootstrap resampling procedure identical to the one used in Experiment 1 but applied to raw performance data. To dampen noise, we smoothed means for each age using a moving 3-year window prior to identifying age of peak performance in each sample. Other methods of dampening noise provide similar results.\n\nLet’s decompose this method (as I understand it) into steps:\n\nWith replacement, sample \\(n\\) observations from the dataset;\nCalculate the mean performance for each sample and age;\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 \\(m\\) times to get multiple samples;\nSort each sample by age and smooth age means using a 3-year rolling average;\nFind the age of peak performance for each sample.\n\n\nimport polars as pl\n\nn = experiment.height\nm = 10000\nnm = n * m\nseed = 37\nsamples = (\n    experiment.sample(nm, with_replacement=True, seed=seed)\n    .with_columns(sample=pl.arange(1, nm + 1) % m)\n    .group_by(\"sample\", \"age\")\n    .agg(mean=pl.col(\"y\").mean())\n    .sort(\"sample\", \"age\")\n    .with_columns(smoothed_mean=pl.col(\"mean\").rolling_mean(3).over(\"sample\"))\n)\npeak = samples.group_by(\"sample\").agg(\n    age=pl.col(\"age\").get(pl.col(\"smoothed_mean\").arg_max())\n)\n\nThis yields the following bootstrap distribution of ages of peak performance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis distribution suggests two important things:\n\nThe most probable age of peak performance is 33;\nThere is a non-negligible probability that the age of peak performance happens in the early 20s, but a negligible probability that it happens in the late 20s.\n\nThing 2 certainly deserves attention. This is possibly caused by a confound variable or some measuring error, but I won’t investigate this any further. Instead, let’s get back to estimating curves. We will use the samples from step 4 to summarize the distribution of mean performances. For each age, we calculate the mean and 90% interquantile range, yielding a nonparametric curve:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure is analogue to figure 3a in the paper. This curve is entirely empirical, so there isn’t much to interpret here. It does indicate, however, the rising and falling behavior of an aging curve, with a steep increase from age 10 to 20, followed by a plateau between 20 and 30, and a slow decline beginning at 40."
