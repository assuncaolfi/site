There are  valid formations , where  indicates exactly how many players of position  are allowed in formation . All formations include  players and  coach, or  for all . The manager begins each round with a budget  and they must pick a team  following a formation . At the end of the round, players receive scores  according to their in-game performance. The manager’s goal is to maximize the team score .\nSince the manager doesn’t know the scores when picking their team, they must estimate score predictions . However, predictions aren’t always accurate. Also, scores of players from the same team are correlated. To minimize the risk of picking many players from a single team and having that team perform badly, the manager might want to include the covariance between players  in the problem. One way to do this is to set a risk aversion  and maximize\n\nFinally, the team is subject to the constraints:\n\nCost less or equal to the budget \nFollow a single formation \nFollow a valid formation .\n\nThis problem is similar to the problem of Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz 1952).\n\nMarkowitz, Harry. 1952. “Portfolio Selection.” The Journal of Finance 7 (1): 77–91. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2975974.\n\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n\ndef problem(predictions, covariance, costs, positions, budget, risk_aversion):\n    picks = cp.Variable(scores.size, \"picks\", boolean=True)\n    formation = cp.Variable(7, \"formation\", boolean=True)\n    objective = cp.Maximize(\n        predictions.T @ picks - risk_aversion * cp.quad_form(picks, covariance)\n    )\n    constraints = [\n        prices.T @ picks &lt;= budget,\n        cp.sum(formation) == 1,\n        positions.T @ picks == formations.T @ formation,\n    ]\n    problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\n    return problem"

These two objectives aren’t necessarily the same, because players increase or decrease in valuation according to scores. Since  depends on the budget , which depends on the scores , one could argue that it might be a good idea to maximize a balance between scoring and valuation. In the next section, I’ll show that maximizing the score for each round is sufficient for maximizing the total score, given good enough predictions.\nFor now, I’ll define a function to simulate the manager’s performance across an entire season. At the start of the season, the manager has a budget of .
